## Executive Summary

**1. Performance Overview**  
This week (2026-W06), Liam handled 24 total calls, which is a modest but directionally useful sample (above the 20-call threshold for basic trend reading). Liam routed 14 of 24 calls, yielding a 58% routing rate. While overall volume is still relatively low, this level of routing indicates Liam is consistently engaging with a meaningful share of inbound demand rather than primarily filtering spam or short calls. Spam and after-hours traffic were minimal, with 0 spam calls and only 1 “spam likely” call (4%, 1/24), keeping the focus on genuine customer interactions.

**2. Routing Effectiveness**  
Routing effectiveness was strong this week. Every routed call had a corresponding transfer attempt (14 transfer attempts, 14 routed calls), and the transfer failure rate was 0% (0/14). From a business continuity and lead-handling standpoint, this means that whenever Liam determined a call should be handed off, the handoff completed successfully. This reliability in transfer execution reduces the risk of dropped opportunities at the critical point between automation and human follow-up.

**3. Caller Experience**  
Caller experience indicators were generally positive. There were no hangups before route (0/24), suggesting callers are staying engaged through Liam’s initial interaction and into routing decisions. For routed calls, average handling time before transfer was 47 seconds (median 35 seconds), which is a reasonable pre-transfer engagement window. Not-routed calls were shorter, with an average of 17 seconds and a 90th percentile of 24 seconds, indicating that non-actionable or low-intent calls are being identified and resolved quickly, minimizing wasted time for both callers and staff.

**4. Strategic Insights**  
With a 0% transfer failure rate (0/14) and no pre-route hangups (0/24), the primary opportunity is to focus on increasing the proportion of calls that reach a routing decision, while preserving this reliability. A targeted review of the 5 not-routed calls—listening for patterns in caller intent, phrasing, or confusion—could highlight small conversational or prompt adjustments that convert more of these into routed opportunities without extending call duration significantly. This is a low-risk optimization area that can incrementally lift the effective routing rate and business value of each inbound call.
