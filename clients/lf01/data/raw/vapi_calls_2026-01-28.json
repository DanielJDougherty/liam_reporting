    "summary": "Here's a summary of the interaction:\n\n**Summary of Interaction:**\n\nThe user called because their gutters are clogged. The AI assistant, Liam, identified this intent and attempted to transfer the user to a service department, providing a number (774133896) as part of the transfer process. The call ended with the customer hanging up.\n\n**What is important to the caller:**\n\n*   Their gutters are clogged. This implies a need for a solution, likely gutter cleaning or a gutter protection system like LeafFilter to prevent future clogs.\n\n**Relevant information for agents:**\n\n*   **Customer Service Agent:** The customer has a current problem (clogged gutters). They might be calling to schedule a cleaning, inquire about LeafFilter as a solution, or troubleshoot an existing LeafFilter system if they are a current customer. The agent should be prepared to discuss cleaning services or product benefits.\n*   **In-Home Sales Agent:** This is a prime lead for LeafFilter. The customer explicitly states their pain point (clogged gutters), which is exactly what LeafFilter aims to solve. A sales agent should follow up to offer a free estimate and demonstrate how LeafFilter prevents clogs.\n*   **Installation Technician:** Not directly relevant at this stage, as no sale or service has been scheduled. However, if a sales agent secures a deal, the technician would need to know the primary issue was clogging.\n\n**Sentiment:**\n\n*   **Neutral.** The user's statement \"My gutters are clogged\" is factual and direct. There's no discernible emotion (positive or negative) expressed in this very brief interaction.\n\n**Ease of Interaction:**\n\n*   **Easy (for the AI).** The AI successfully identified the user's intent based on a simple, direct statement.\n*   **Unknown (for the user).** We don't know if the transfer was successful or if the user hung up because they didn't want to be transferred, the transfer failed, or they found another solution.\n\n**Frustration or Elevation:**\n\n*   **None detected.** The interaction was too brief to show any signs of frustration or elevation from the caller.\n\n**Was this call resolved?**\n\n*   **No, the call was not resolved.** The user's stated problem (\"My gutters are clogged\") was not addressed or scheduled for service. The AI's action was to initiate a transfer, but the call ended with the customer hanging up before any resolution could occur. The \"customer-ended-call\" reason confirms the customer disconnected without completing their objective.",

The caller cannot hear them.\nWhen transferring: call the tool, then say a short phrase like \"Connecting you now.\"\nExample: transfer_intent(\"+18774133674\") then say \"Connecting you to sales.\"\nThe phone number goes in the tool only. Say words to the caller, not numbers.\n\n## ABSOLUTE RULES\n1. GREETING ONCE ONLY - Say greeting ONLY if no user messages exist yet.\n2. Tool calls are SILENT - say words to caller, not phone numbers\n3. When intent is clear → CALL TOOL IMMEDIATELY, no extra questions\n4. Always say \"we\" when referring to LeafFilter\n5. DO NOT answer general questions - just clarify and route\n\n## STATE CHECK (every turn)\n- If user has NOT spoken yet → Say greeting, then STOP\n- If user HAS spoken → DO NOT greet. Classify intent and act.\n\n## GREETING (ONLY when no user messages)\n\"I'm Liam, an automated assistant here to get you to the right LeafFilter team instantly. You can speak to me just like a human—what do you need help with?\"\nIf you are ever interrupted during your greeting, stop talking, let the user talk and NEVER read your tool call out loud.\n\n## ROUTING - CALL TOOL IMMEDIATELY WHEN INTENT MATCHES\n\nESCALATION - CHECK THIS FIRST (angry/upset/mad/frustrated/complaint/manager/human):\n→ transfer_intent(\"+18774137848\") then say \"Let me get someone who can help you right away.\"\nNOTE: If caller sounds upset OR mentions complaint, ALWAYS route here. Never say \"billing team\" for upset callers.\n\nIMPORTANT: DO NOT CALL (\"don't call me\"/\"stop calling\"):\n→ Say \"Understood, I'll make sure that's noted. Have a good day.\" then end the call.\n\nMAILING LIST (\"take me off your mailing list\"/\"remove me from mailing list\"):\n→ Say \"I can't manage mailing lists directly.\" then ask the related issue (is it marketing, installation, billing or other?)\n\nSALES (quote/price/estimate/cost/how much/new/schedule estimate - NEW clients):\n→ transfer_intent(\"+18774133674\") then say \"Connecting you to sales.\"\n\nSCHEDULING (reschedule/cancel/confirm EXISTING estimate appointment):\n→ transfer_intent(\"+18774131604\") then say \"Connecting you to scheduling.\"\nNOTE: This is for people who ALREADY have an estimate scheduled. New clients go to SALES.\n\nINSTALLATION (install date/reschedule/cancel install/installer questions):\n→ transfer_intent(\"+18774133681\") then say \"Connecting you to installation.\"\n\nSERVICE (leak/clog/repair/overflow/refund - CONFIRMED existing customer):\n→ transfer_intent(\"+18774133896\") then say \"Connecting you to service.\"\n\nWARRANTY (register warranty/warranty claim):\n→ transfer_intent(\"+18776817937\") then say \"Connecting you to warranty.\"\n\nBILLING (invoice/charges - NOT payments/refunds):\n→ transfer_intent(\"+18774137848\") then say \"Connecting you to billing.\"\n\nMAIN OFFICE (job/careers/HR/vendor/marketing):\n→ transfer_intent(\"+18774137848\") then say \"Connecting you to our office.\"\n\nCANCEL APPOINTMENT (ALWAYS clarify - never route directly):\nWhen caller says \"cancel appointment\" or \"cancel my appointment\" → ALWAYS ask clarification first\n\n## CLARIFY ONLY IF UNCLEAR (ONE question max, then route)\n\nGutter issue + unknown if customer: \nAsk: \"Do you have LeafFilter installed?\"\n- Yes → SERVICE\n- No → SALES\n\nGeneral gutter question (\"do you clean gutters?\"):\nAsk: \"Are you an existing LeafFilter customer, or interested in getting a quote?\"\n- Customer → SERVICE  \n- Quote → SALES\nDO NOT explain what LeafFilter does. Just ask, then route.\n\nAmbiguous appointment (new, get a quote, etc):\nAsk: \"Is this for an estimate or installation?\"\n- Estimate → SALES\n- Installation → INSTALLATION\n\nAmbiguous appointment (ONLY when caller says cancel/reschedule/confirm):\nAsk: \"Is this for a free estimate or a scheduled installation?\"\n- Free estimate → SCHEDULING\n- Installation → INSTALLATION\n\n## SILENCE\n1st: \"I'm here, what can I help with?\"\n2nd: \"New quote or existing customer?\"\n3rd: transfer_intent(\"+18774137848\") then \"Connecting you now.\"\n\n## EXECUTION\n1. CALL transfer_intent(destination) ← THIS IS SILENT\n2. SPEAK short confirmation (max 10 words)\n3. STOP - say nothing else\n\n## NEVER SAY\n- Phone numbers\n- \"ladder\" or \"off that ladder\"  \n- \"Awesome, let's get you a price\"\n- The greeting more than once\n- \"billing team\" unless they asked about billing/invoices\n- \"they\" when referring to LeafFilter (use \"we\")\n- Long explanations about what LeafFilter does",

      "summary": "Here's a summary of the interaction:\n\n**Summary of Interaction:**\n\nThe user called because their gutters are clogged. The AI assistant, Liam, identified this intent and attempted to transfer the user to a service department, providing a number (774133896) as part of the transfer process. The call ended with the customer hanging up.\n\n**What is important to the caller:**\n\n*   Their gutters are clogged. This implies a need for a solution, likely gutter cleaning or a gutter protection system like LeafFilter to prevent future clogs.\n\n**Relevant information for agents:**\n\n*   **Customer Service Agent:** The customer has a current problem (clogged gutters). They might be calling to schedule a cleaning, inquire about LeafFilter as a solution, or troubleshoot an existing LeafFilter system if they are a current customer. The agent should be prepared to discuss cleaning services or product benefits.\n*   **In-Home Sales Agent:** This is a prime lead for LeafFilter. The customer explicitly states their pain point (clogged gutters), which is exactly what LeafFilter aims to solve. A sales agent should follow up to offer a free estimate and demonstrate how LeafFilter prevents clogs.\n*   **Installation Technician:** Not directly relevant at this stage, as no sale or service has been scheduled. However, if a sales agent secures a deal, the technician would need to know the primary issue was clogging.\n\n**Sentiment:**\n\n*   **Neutral.** The user's statement \"My gutters are clogged\" is factual and direct. There's no discernible emotion (positive or negative) expressed in this very brief interaction.\n\n**Ease of Interaction:**\n\n*   **Easy (for the AI).** The AI successfully identified the user's intent based on a simple, direct statement.\n*   **Unknown (for the user).** We don't know if the transfer was successful or if the user hung up because they didn't want to be transferred, the transfer failed, or they found another solution.\n\n**Frustration or Elevation:**\n\n*   **None detected.** The interaction was too brief to show any signs of frustration or elevation from the caller.\n\n**Was this call resolved?**\n\n*   **No, the call was not resolved.** The user's stated problem (\"My gutters are clogged\") was not addressed or scheduled for service. The AI's action was to initiate a transfer, but the call ended with the customer hanging up before any resolution could occur. The \"customer-ended-call\" reason confirms the customer disconnected without completing their objective.",
